# avltree
Header file with implementation of an AVL tree (self-balancing binary search tree). I found no use in implementing BST since it is mostly the same as AVL tree , but without balancing.
This implementation includes basic mehods as insert, delete, search and print, as well as one additional function that creates a dictionary of words as the Key value and amount of occurances of its Key as an Info value from a .txt file.
And also 2 operators(= and [ ]). 
This header might be used as a help for creating custom hashtable to reach logN complexity of search function.
